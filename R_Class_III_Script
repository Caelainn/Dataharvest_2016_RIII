#In R III we're going to look at some of R's simple tools that allow you to go deeper with your data analysis, digging and visualisation

#In this class we'll look at:
#1. Creating a project
#2. Built in data in R
#3. Basic descriptive statistics
#4. Beyond summary statistics
#5. Further practice


##########################
##1. Creating a project ##
##########################

#We’re going to create a project in R
#This is where all your data and scripts will be held
#Think of it like a folder where everything related to one project is kept

#Before we do that let’s check where this session of R is being run from
#Let's open R and check our working directory
#Type this into the console
getwd()

#What is returned is the “working directory”
#This is the address on the computer where the files are stored
#Why do directories matter in R?

#We could change our working directory with setwd()
#But in this case let’s set the working directory when we start a new project
#In a project you can keep all your scripts, files and analysis in one place

#Let’s follow these steps together…
#Look in the top right corner for a small blue icon - a cube with an R inside
#Click on it and select the first option “New Project”
#Then select “New Directory” from the pop-up dialogue box
#Select “Empty Project”
#In the next dialogue box name your project
#We’re going to call the project “R Class III”
#We also want to check the address or directory where the project will be stored
#This is shown in the “Save a subdirectory of…” box
#In the box is the location on your computer where the project will be saved
#You can change it now if needed
#Let’s all set our working directory to R Class on the Bureaublad (aka Desktop) 

#You can of course move the location later but it can cause complications

##########################
##2. Built in data in R ##
##########################

#R comes with a number of built in packages for analysis
#This means you can run simple analysis on practice data sets

#To see how R gives you the ability to analyse your data simply and effectively we're going to use one it's built in data packages

#To see a full list of the packages
data()

#We're going to use airquality dataset for this class
#Open it up and take a look…
airquality

#Let’s also find out more about the dataset
?airquality

#If we were going to use this in a story about air pollution what might we want to know?

###################################
##3. Descriptive statistics in R ##
###################################

#We've already looked at what to do when you have a data set and you need to clean it or join data to a table
#What about when you want to explore the data itself?

#The first step is to look at the descriptive statistics
#What are descriptive statistics?

#The summary function gives you basic descriptive statistics 
??summary

#Let’s look at the summary statistics for the Wind column in the airquality dataset
summary(airquality$Wind)

#Let’s look through the details of what is returned from this query…
#What might you want to use these for?

#Let’s run the summary analysis for the entire dataset
summary(airquality)

#There are some unusual results in there
#Any ideas why we are getting the summary stats for month and day?

#Looking at the results, what might you use from this to describe your data? 
#Let’s come up with a few top lines from the data for a story…


#################################
##4. Beyond summary statistics ##
#################################

#Let’s load in a new dataset from my github page
#We’re going to look at data on smokers
#Props to Mike Marin on this dataset…

#Let’s read in the data
#Note we’re reading in a table this time
lung <- read.table("LungCapData.txt", header=T)

#What’s different about this data to that of before?

#Let’s check out the data headers
names(lung)

#Of course we can also get the summary statistics for the entire table as well
summary(lung)
#What is different in this summary table to the first one we created?

#If we want to summarize a categorical variable, Smoke, this is done in a summary table
#It’s summarized by a frequency or proportion
table(lung$Smoke)

#So we know the number of smokers and non-smokers
#Let’s get the total number of people in the survey
length(lung$Smoke)

#Let’s use this to calculate the proportion of smokers and non-smokers
table(lung$Smoke)/725

#Or we can do it like this…
table(lung$Smoke)/length(lung$Smoke)
#Why does this also work?

#Let’s look at this based on the gender breakdown
table(lung$Smoke, lung$Gender)

#Let’s look at working with the numeric variables in the data set
#We’ll consider the appropriate number to use looking at the average…
mean(lung$LungCap)

#We can also trim the mean if we are concerned that there may be outliers
mean(lung$LungCap, trim=0.10)

#What can you tell by comparing the results of the mean and the trimmed mean?

#Let’s look at the median as well
median(lung$LungCap)

#Based on these results what number might you want to report in your story?

#Let’s take a further look at some of the further simple stats functions..

#To calculate the variance use var
var(lung$LungCap)
#When might we use this?

#Let’s get the standard deviation
sd(lung$LungCap)

#Let’s look at the correlation between lung capacity and age
cor(lung$LungCap, lung$Age)
#How can we interpret the result?

#What other variables appear to have a strong correlation?

##5. FURTHER PRACTICE ##
########################

#There are plenty of built in datasets to play with in R
#They can be really useful for practicing and building up confidence
#To find built in datasets in R try this...
data()

#If you’re into machine learning, there are some great exercises on Kaggle
#The Titanic machine learning exercise with R is one of my favourites
#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32o0DnuRjfg

#You should also look into packages like httr for API calls
